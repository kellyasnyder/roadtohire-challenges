VERY EASY: Create a bulleted list of the colors of the rainbow
    <ul>
        <li>red</li>
        <li>orange</li>
        <li>yellow</li>
        <li>green</li>
        <li>blue</li>
        <li>indigo</li>
        <li>violet</li>
    </ul>

EASY: Create an HTML page with a main headline, two subheads in their own sections and supporting text for each subhead. Topic is up to you. Make sure you have a page title.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>title goes here</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1></h1>
    </body>
    </html>

MEDIUM: Recreate the website outline given using semantic HTML. The topic can be of your choosing.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>title goes here</title>
    </head>
    <bo        <input type="checkbox" name="pizza" value="peaches" /> Peaches<br />
dy>
        <h1></h1>
    </body>
    </html>

HARD: Create an HTML form with a GET method that will collect the following: First Name, Last Name, Gender (have them pick), Favorite sport (from a dropdown list of at least 5), Checkboxes for what you like on your pizza (from a list of at least 5) and
the submit button should read, "Save".

VERY HARD: Create a horizontal navigation of 5 items, one of the items should have a dropdown menu when you hover over it.

VERY HARD: Given a comma separated string of full names, use JavaScript to create an alphabetical-by-Last-Name, ordered list and have it display in HTML. Make the last names bold and red using CSS (NOT inline styles).
## Note: Don't freak out about the last one
